# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

testing every method for DataUtilities
Range: one getter, contains, intersects, shift (2arg), expandToInclude

To develop our test cases, we will be using Equivalence Class Testing (ECT). This means we will begin our test development by partitioning the domain for each method. We will be using strong ECT to test the system. We will begin testing for each method by defining the domain of the method. We will then determine the different ranges in each domain for valid and invalid values. Then we will build a test case for every possible combination of domain ranges. This process will be described in depth in section 3 for each test case.

// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above
